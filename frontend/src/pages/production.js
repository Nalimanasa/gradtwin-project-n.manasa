        >Aluminium (or aluminum) is a light, silvery-white metal that is strong <br/>
         malleable, ductile, and highly conductive, known for forming a protective oxide<br/>
          layer that resists corrosion.

        <p  class="paragraph"
        >Stainless steel is a family of iron-based alloys known for their high chromium content (minimum 10.5%), which forms a passive, self-healing oxide layer on the surface, making them resistant to rust and corrosion.

        <p class="paragraph"
        >Mild steel, or low-carbon steel, is a versatile and cost-effective form of iron and carbon, containing a low carbon content (typically 0.05%â€“0.25%) that makes it ductile, machinable, and easily weldable but difficult to harden.  </p>
